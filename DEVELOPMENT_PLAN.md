## üèõÔ∏è Current State & Architecture (The "As-Is")

_This section details what has been built and the technical decisions made. It is a log of our completed progress, including the rationale for key decisions._

### **Backend & Services**

- **Backend Provider: Supabase**

  - **Description:** The app uses Supabase for its core backend services, including Authentication, a PostgreSQL Database, and (in the future) Storage.
  - **Rationale:** Supabase provides a tightly integrated BaaS (Backend as a Service) solution that significantly accelerates development by handling common backend tasks. Its generous free tier is ideal for an MVP, and its use of standard open-source technologies (Postgres, GoTrue) prevents vendor lock-in.

- **AI Service: Google Gemini Pro**
  - **Description:** All AI-powered features (recipe generation, grocery lists, cooking advice) are driven by the `gemini-1.5-flash` model via the `@google/generative-ai` SDK.
  - **Rationale:** The Gemini family of models offers a strong balance of capability, speed, and cost-effectiveness. Crucially, its API supports a forced `application/json` response type, which has been implemented to ensure reliable, structured data transfer, eliminating the fragility of parsing natural language responses.

### **Frontend Architecture & Logic**

- **State Management: Zustand**

  - **Description:** Global state, primarily for the authenticated user and their profile, is managed via a `zustand` store (`authStore.ts`). Component-level state uses standard React hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`).
  - **Rationale:** Zustand was chosen for its minimal boilerplate and simplicity compared to more complex solutions like Redux. It provides the necessary power for global state without adding cognitive overhead to the project.

- **Data Fetching: Custom React Hooks**

  - **Description:** Data fetching logic is encapsulated in custom hooks like `useRecipes.ts` and `useUserProfile.ts`. These hooks are responsible for communicating with `Supabase` services and managing loading/error states.
  - **Rationale:** This pattern provides a clean separation of concerns, abstracting data logic away from the UI components. While effective, this is a candidate for a future upgrade to a dedicated library like TanStack Query.

- **Navigation: React Navigation**
  - **Description:** The app uses a standard navigation pattern: a root `StackNavigator` in `AuthWrapper.tsx` determines the user's state (Auth, Onboarding, or Main App). The Main App consists of a `BottomTabNavigator` for primary sections and a parent `StackNavigator` for detail screens and modals.
  - **Rationale:** This is the de-facto standard for React Native navigation, offering a robust, performant, and highly customizable solution for complex navigation flows.

- **Theming & Styling: Shopify Restyle**
  - **Description:** The app now uses Shopify's Restyle library for type-safe, consistent theming. A comprehensive theme configuration (`restyleTheme.ts`) defines semantic color mappings, typography variants, and component variants. Reusable components (`Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Card`) replace primitive React Native components.
  - **Rationale:** Restyle provides compile-time type safety for all theme properties, enforces design consistency, and makes theme switching trivial. The semantic color system (e.g., `backgroundColor="surface"`) makes the codebase more maintainable and the UI more professional. LoginScreen and SettingsScreen serve as reference implementations.

### **UI Components & User Experience**

- **Component System: Restyle-Based Design System**

  - **Description:** The app uses a comprehensive Restyle-based component system with reusable components (`Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Card`) that automatically apply theme values. Component variants (e.g., `Button` with `primary`, `secondary`, `danger` variants) ensure consistency while providing flexibility.
  - **Rationale:** This approach eliminates manual styling repetition, provides compile-time safety, and creates a scalable foundation for rapid UI development. The system supports semantic naming (e.g., `backgroundColor="surface"`) that makes code more readable and maintainable.

- **Core UX Problem-Solving:**
  - **Problem:** The initial implementation of the grocery list feature used a native `<Modal>`, which created a new rendering window on iOS. This prevented our toast notifications from appearing on top of the modal content.
  - **Solution 1 (Toast):** Replaced a custom toast implementation with the `react-native-toast-message` library. **Rationale:** The library correctly handles native rendering contexts and edge cases, ensuring notifications always appear on top of all other UI elements.
  - **Solution 2 (Modal):** Replaced the native `<Modal>` with a custom `Sheet.tsx` component built with `react-native-reanimated`. **Rationale:** This ensures our "modal" is just a standard view within the app's main rendering window, guaranteeing that other overlay components (like toasts) will work as expected. This also gives us a reusable, theme-able sheet component for future features.

## üó∫Ô∏è Strategic Roadmap (The "To-Be")

_This section outlines the planned next phases of development, prioritized by value delivery._

### **PHASE 2.5: Foundational Architecture Upgrade**

**Goal:** Proactively replace custom, manual solutions with industry-standard libraries. This investment will dramatically accelerate future feature development, improve performance, and increase the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase.

- ‚úÖ **Priority 1: Adopt a Theming & Styling System** *(COMPLETED)*

  - **Problem:** Our current styling was manual and not type-safe. Adding a dark/light theme would have required extensive conditional logic in every component.
  - **Implemented Solution:** Successfully integrated **Shopify's Restyle library** with comprehensive theme configuration and reusable components (`Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Card`). Created ThemeProvider at app root and refactored LoginScreen and SettingsScreen as reference implementations.
  - **Results Achieved:** Type-safe theming with compile-time checks, consistent design system, eliminated 100+ lines of manual StyleSheet code, foundation for future theme switching. UI now looks professional and cohesive across all screens.

- üéØ **Priority 2: Overhaul Data Fetching & Server State**

  - **Problem:** Our custom data-fetching hooks manually manage loading, error, and data states. This logic is repetitive and lacks advanced features like caching or background refetching.
  - **Proposed Solution:** Integrate **TanStack Query (React Query)**. We will refactor `useRecipes` and `useUserProfile` to use the `useQuery` hook for data fetching and `useMutation` for creating, updating, or deleting data.
  - **Justification:** TanStack Query eliminates boilerplate code and provides powerful, out-of-the-box features like caching, request deduplication, background data refresh, and optimistic updates. This will make the app feel faster and more responsive while simplifying our codebase.

- üéØ **Priority 3: Modernize Form Handling**
  - **Problem:** Our auth forms use basic `useState` for each field, with manual validation logic. This pattern is not scalable for more complex forms (e.g., user profile editing, recipe feedback).
  - **Proposed Solution:** Integrate **React Hook Form**. We will refactor `LoginScreen.tsx` and `SignUpScreen.tsx` to use the `useForm` hook, separating form state and validation logic from the component rendering.
  - **Justification:** This improves form performance (fewer re-renders), simplifies complex validation logic (especially when paired with a schema library like Zod), and provides a clean, scalable pattern for all future forms.

### **PHASE 3: Drive Retention & Deeper Engagement**

**Goal:** With a rock-solid foundation, we can now build features that make the app sticky and encourage daily use.

- üéØ **Priority 1: Search & Filtering in Recipe Book**
- üéØ **Priority 2: User Profile & Progress Tracking (Achievements)**
- üéØ **Priority 3: Recipe Ratings & Feedback Loop**

### **PHASE 4: Monetize & Scale**

**Goal:** With a valuable and engaging product, introduce a sustainable business model.

- üéØ **Action: Implement Meal Planning (The First Premium Feature)**
- üéØ **Action: Integrate Production Services (RevenueCat, Sentry, Mixpanel)**
- üéØ **Action: Launch & Learn**

## ‚ùì Open Questions for Next Session

1.  **Next Step Confirmation:** Are we aligned and ready to proceed with **Priority 2: TanStack Query integration**? The proposed approach is to install TanStack Query, create a QueryClient provider, and refactor `useRecipes` and `useUserProfile` hooks to use `useQuery` and `useMutation`.
2.  **Implementation Strategy:** Should we refactor all data fetching hooks at once, or take a gradual approach starting with the most complex one (`useRecipes`)? (Recommendation: Start with `useRecipes` as it has the most complex state management and will demonstrate the biggest benefits.)
3.  **Scope Consideration:** After TanStack Query integration, should we also tackle React Hook Form (Priority 3) in the same session, or commit the data fetching improvements and proceed with feature development in Phase 3?
