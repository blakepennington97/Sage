## üèõÔ∏è Current State & Architecture (The "As-Is")

_This section details what has been built and the technical decisions made. It is a log of our completed progress, including the rationale for key decisions._

### **Backend & Services**

- **Backend Provider: Supabase**

  - **Description:** The app uses Supabase for its core backend services, including Authentication, a PostgreSQL Database, and (in the future) Storage.
  - **Rationale:** Supabase provides a tightly integrated BaaS (Backend as a Service) solution that significantly accelerates development by handling common backend tasks. Its generous free tier is ideal for an MVP, and its use of standard open-source technologies (Postgres, GoTrue) prevents vendor lock-in.

- **AI Service: Google Gemini Pro**
  - **Description:** All AI-powered features (recipe generation, grocery lists, cooking advice) are driven by the `gemini-1.5-flash` model via the `@google/generative-ai` SDK.
  - **Rationale:** The Gemini family of models offers a strong balance of capability, speed, and cost-effectiveness. Crucially, its API supports a forced `application/json` response type, which has been implemented to ensure reliable, structured data transfer, eliminating the fragility of parsing natural language responses.

### **Frontend Architecture & Logic**

- **State Management: Zustand**

  - **Description:** Global state, primarily for the authenticated user and their profile, is managed via a `zustand` store (`authStore.ts`). Component-level state uses standard React hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`).
  - **Rationale:** Zustand was chosen for its minimal boilerplate and simplicity compared to more complex solutions like Redux. It provides the necessary power for global state without adding cognitive overhead to the project.

- **Data Fetching: TanStack Query**

  - **Description:** Data fetching is now powered by TanStack Query with intelligent caching, optimistic updates, and automatic background refetching. The `useRecipes` and `useUserProfile` hooks use `useQuery` for data fetching and `useMutation` for state changes, with proper error handling and loading states.
  - **Rationale:** TanStack Query eliminates manual state management boilerplate, provides powerful caching with 5-minute stale time, enables optimistic updates for instant UI feedback, and includes automatic retry logic. This significantly improves app performance and user experience while reducing code complexity.

- **Navigation: React Navigation**
  - **Description:** The app uses a standard navigation pattern: a root `StackNavigator` in `AuthWrapper.tsx` determines the user's state (Auth, Onboarding, or Main App). The Main App consists of a `BottomTabNavigator` for primary sections and a parent `StackNavigator` for detail screens and modals.
  - **Rationale:** This is the de-facto standard for React Native navigation, offering a robust, performant, and highly customizable solution for complex navigation flows.

- **Theming & Styling: Shopify Restyle**
  - **Description:** The app now uses Shopify's Restyle library for type-safe, consistent theming. A comprehensive theme configuration (`restyleTheme.ts`) defines semantic color mappings, typography variants, and component variants. Reusable components (`Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Card`) replace primitive React Native components.
  - **Rationale:** Restyle provides compile-time type safety for all theme properties, enforces design consistency, and makes theme switching trivial. The semantic color system (e.g., `backgroundColor="surface"`) makes the codebase more maintainable and the UI more professional. LoginScreen and SettingsScreen serve as reference implementations.

- **Form Handling: React Hook Form**
  - **Description:** All forms now use React Hook Form with the `useForm` hook and `Controller` components for field management. The auth screens implement declarative validation rules with proper error handling and accessibility. Form state is separated from component rendering logic.
  - **Rationale:** React Hook Form provides superior performance with fewer re-renders, built-in validation with clear error messaging, and a scalable pattern for complex forms. The `Controller` wrapper integrates seamlessly with our Restyle Input components while maintaining type safety and consistent theming.

- **Achievement System: Gamification & Progress Tracking**
  - **Description:** Comprehensive achievement system with 16 achievements across 5 categories, user leveling (Kitchen Newbie ‚Üí Culinary Legend), progress rings, and detailed statistics. Achievement service calculates progress in real-time based on user activity (recipes generated, cooking sessions, skill progression, streaks, favorites).
  - **Rationale:** Gamification significantly improves user retention and engagement by providing clear goals, visual feedback, and celebration of progress. Achievement categories target different user motivations, from skill development to consistency building, creating multiple pathways for users to feel accomplished and motivated to continue cooking.

- **Advanced User Profile & AI Personalization System**
  - **Description:** Comprehensive 4-category preference system: (1) Dietary & Health (allergies, diet style, nutrition goals, spice tolerance), (2) Cooking Context (time constraints, budget, serving sizes, lifestyle), (3) Kitchen Capabilities (appliances, storage, technique comfort levels), (4) Cooking Styles (cuisines, moods, favorite/avoided ingredients). Replaces nuclear "reset profile" with granular editing that preserves achievements.
  - **Rationale:** Dramatically improves AI recipe quality by providing rich user context for personalization. Progressive disclosure UI scales from basic to power users. Separate preference versioning enables data migration. Enhanced AI prompts now consider dietary restrictions, time constraints, equipment availability, and cuisine preferences for truly personalized recommendations.

- **Recipe Rating & Feedback System**
  - **Description:** Interactive 5-star rating system with StarRating component, modernized RecipeDetailScreen using Restyle theming, real-time rating updates with optimistic UI, and user feedback collection for AI improvement.
  - **Rationale:** Creates feedback loop for continuous AI improvement while providing users with easy recipe evaluation. Positive reinforcement encourages engagement. Rating data can inform future recipe recommendations and identify popular vs. poor recipes for algorithm refinement.

- **Production Error Handling & Reliability**
  - **Description:** Comprehensive ErrorBoundary component with fallback UI and retry functionality, centralized ErrorHandler utility for consistent error management, enhanced LoadingSpinner and ErrorMessage components with Restyle theming, and network error detection with user-friendly messaging.
  - **Rationale:** Prevents app crashes and provides graceful error recovery. Consistent error handling improves user experience during network failures or API issues. Production-ready error boundaries ensure app stability in all scenarios.

- **Meal Planning Premium Feature**
  - **Description:** Complete weekly meal planning system with MealPlanCard components, WeeklyMealGrid horizontal scrolling interface, PremiumGate monetization flow, recipe assignment/removal functionality, and grocery list generation. Includes proper database schema with RLS policies and premium feature gating.
  - **Rationale:** First premium feature providing clear value proposition for subscription conversion. Weekly meal planning addresses core user need of "what's for dinner" anxiety. Premium gating creates natural upgrade funnel while demonstrating advanced app capabilities.

- **Modern Navigation & UX System**
  - **Description:** Comprehensive navigation system with gesture-based controls, swipe navigation, proper header back buttons, and crash-free onboarding flow. Includes fixed profile reset navigation error and modern app interaction patterns throughout all screens.
  - **Rationale:** Essential for production app quality. Modern gesture-based navigation meets user expectations and prevents app crashes. Proper navigation flow ensures smooth onboarding and user retention.

- **Modern UI Component System**
  - **Description:** Advanced UI components including gesture-based Slider component replacing 5-button arrays, responsive text handling with proper constraints, safe area support for all screen sizes, and modern interaction patterns. Text wrapping issues resolved across all buttons and headers.
  - **Rationale:** Professional UI appearance and smooth interactions are critical for user engagement. Modern sliders provide better user experience than button arrays. Responsive design ensures app works correctly on all device sizes.

- **Enhanced Recipe Generation Flow**
  - **Description:** Streamlined recipe creation with direct generation option in meal planner, intelligent "Suggest me something" system with 10 contextual recipe suggestions, and seamless integration between meal planning and recipe generation workflows.
  - **Rationale:** Reduces friction in core user workflow. Direct generation from meal planner eliminates navigation steps. Smart suggestions help users who lack inspiration, increasing engagement with recipe generation feature.

- **Advanced Preference Customization System**
  - **Description:** Comprehensive custom preference system allowing users to add unlimited custom options beyond presets: (1) Custom cuisines with inline input and validation, (2) Custom favorite and avoided ingredients with Alert.prompt interface, (3) Custom kitchen appliances with space/underscore normalization, (4) Custom dietary restrictions including allergies, intolerances, and health objectives. Enhanced AI prompts process all custom preferences with proper formatting (underscore to space conversion) and equal priority to standard options.
  - **Rationale:** Eliminates restriction to preset options, accommodating diverse user needs and cultural preferences. Custom cuisines support global food cultures beyond standard Western options. Custom appliances recognize modern kitchen tools and emerging cooking equipment. Custom dietary restrictions handle specific allergies, cultural dietary laws, and personal health goals. AI integration ensures custom preferences drive recipe personalization with same importance as preset options, dramatically improving relevance for users with unique needs.

### **UI Components & User Experience**

- **Component System: Restyle-Based Design System**
  - **Description:** The app uses a comprehensive Restyle-based component system with reusable components (`Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Card`) that automatically apply theme values. Component variants (e.g., `Button` with `primary`, `secondary`, `danger` variants) ensure consistency while providing flexibility. All screens now use consistent theming including CookingCoachScreen modernization.
  - **Rationale:** This approach eliminates manual styling repetition, provides compile-time safety, and creates a scalable foundation for rapid UI development. The system supports semantic naming (e.g., `backgroundColor="surface"`) that makes code more readable and maintainable.

- **Search & Discovery: Intelligent Recipe Filtering**
  - **Description:** Advanced search and filtering system for the Recipe Book with real-time text search, intuitive difficulty filtering (Beginner, Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert with emojis and colors), favorites toggle, and **preference-driven filtering**. "My Preferences" toggle automatically filters recipes based on user's dietary restrictions, typical cooking time, preferred cuisines, and other personalization settings.
  - **Rationale:** As recipe collections grow, discoverability becomes crucial for user engagement. The intelligent filtering system now considers user preferences to surface recipes that truly match their cooking style, time constraints, and dietary needs. This dramatically improves recipe relevance and encourages both exploration and regular use of saved recipes.

- **User Profile & Navigation: Modal-Based Settings**
  - **Description:** Renamed "Settings" tab to "Profile" reflecting the achievement-focused content. Settings moved to a clean Sheet modal accessible via gear icon, eliminating the need to scroll through long profile content to access configuration options.
  - **Rationale:** Clear separation between motivational profile content (achievements, progress, stats) and functional settings (account, API keys, profile reset). Modal-based settings provide immediate access without disrupting the profile viewing experience, following modern mobile UX patterns.

- **Core UX Problem-Solving:**
  - **Problem:** The initial implementation of the grocery list feature used a native `<Modal>`, which created a new rendering window on iOS. This prevented our toast notifications from appearing on top of the modal content.
  - **Solution 1 (Toast):** Replaced a custom toast implementation with the `react-native-toast-message` library. **Rationale:** The library correctly handles native rendering contexts and edge cases, ensuring notifications always appear on top of all other UI elements.
  - **Solution 2 (Modal):** Replaced the native `<Modal>` with a custom `Sheet.tsx` component built with `react-native-reanimated`. **Rationale:** This ensures our "modal" is just a standard view within the app's main rendering window, guaranteeing that other overlay components (like toasts) will work as expected. This also gives us a reusable, theme-able sheet component for future features.
