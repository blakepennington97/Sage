## üèõÔ∏è Current State & Architecture (The "As-Is")

_This section details what has been built and the technical decisions made. It is a log of our completed progress, including the rationale for key decisions._

### **Backend & Services**

- **Backend Provider: Supabase**

  - **Description:** The app uses Supabase for its core backend services, including Authentication, a PostgreSQL Database, and (in the future) Storage.
  - **Rationale:** Supabase provides a tightly integrated BaaS (Backend as a Service) solution that significantly accelerates development by handling common backend tasks. Its generous free tier is ideal for an MVP, and its use of standard open-source technologies (Postgres, GoTrue) prevents vendor lock-in.

- **AI Service: Google Gemini Pro**
  - **Description:** All AI-powered features (recipe generation, grocery lists, cooking advice) are driven by the `gemini-1.5-flash` model via the `@google/generative-ai` SDK.
  - **Rationale:** The Gemini family of models offers a strong balance of capability, speed, and cost-effectiveness. Crucially, its API supports a forced `application/json` response type, which has been implemented to ensure reliable, structured data transfer, eliminating the fragility of parsing natural language responses.

### **Frontend Architecture & Logic**

- **State Management: Zustand**

  - **Description:** Global state, primarily for the authenticated user and their profile, is managed via a `zustand` store (`authStore.ts`). Component-level state uses standard React hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`).
  - **Rationale:** Zustand was chosen for its minimal boilerplate and simplicity compared to more complex solutions like Redux. It provides the necessary power for global state without adding cognitive overhead to the project.

- **Data Fetching: TanStack Query**

  - **Description:** Data fetching is now powered by TanStack Query with intelligent caching, optimistic updates, and automatic background refetching. The `useRecipes` and `useUserProfile` hooks use `useQuery` for data fetching and `useMutation` for state changes, with proper error handling and loading states.
  - **Rationale:** TanStack Query eliminates manual state management boilerplate, provides powerful caching with 5-minute stale time, enables optimistic updates for instant UI feedback, and includes automatic retry logic. This significantly improves app performance and user experience while reducing code complexity.

- **Navigation: React Navigation**
  - **Description:** The app uses a standard navigation pattern: a root `StackNavigator` in `AuthWrapper.tsx` determines the user's state (Auth, Onboarding, or Main App). The Main App consists of a `BottomTabNavigator` for primary sections and a parent `StackNavigator` for detail screens and modals.
  - **Rationale:** This is the de-facto standard for React Native navigation, offering a robust, performant, and highly customizable solution for complex navigation flows.

- **Theming & Styling: Shopify Restyle**
  - **Description:** The app now uses Shopify's Restyle library for type-safe, consistent theming. A comprehensive theme configuration (`restyleTheme.ts`) defines semantic color mappings, typography variants, and component variants. Reusable components (`Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Card`) replace primitive React Native components.
  - **Rationale:** Restyle provides compile-time type safety for all theme properties, enforces design consistency, and makes theme switching trivial. The semantic color system (e.g., `backgroundColor="surface"`) makes the codebase more maintainable and the UI more professional. LoginScreen and SettingsScreen serve as reference implementations.

- **Form Handling: React Hook Form**
  - **Description:** All forms now use React Hook Form with the `useForm` hook and `Controller` components for field management. The auth screens implement declarative validation rules with proper error handling and accessibility. Form state is separated from component rendering logic.
  - **Rationale:** React Hook Form provides superior performance with fewer re-renders, built-in validation with clear error messaging, and a scalable pattern for complex forms. The `Controller` wrapper integrates seamlessly with our Restyle Input components while maintaining type safety and consistent theming.

- **Achievement System: Gamification & Progress Tracking**
  - **Description:** Comprehensive achievement system with 16 achievements across 5 categories, user leveling (Kitchen Newbie ‚Üí Culinary Legend), progress rings, and detailed statistics. Achievement service calculates progress in real-time based on user activity (recipes generated, cooking sessions, skill progression, streaks, favorites).

  - **Rationale:** This approach eliminates manual styling repetition, provides compile-time safety, and creates a scalable foundation for rapid UI development. The system supports semantic naming (e.g., `backgroundColor="surface"`) that makes code more readable and maintainable.

- **Search & Discovery: Intelligent Recipe Filtering**
  - **Description:** Advanced search and filtering system for the Recipe Book with real-time text search, intuitive difficulty filtering (Beginner, Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert with emojis and colors), favorites toggle, and **preference-driven filtering**. "My Preferences" toggle automatically filters recipes based on user's dietary restrictions, typical cooking time, preferred cuisines, and other personalization settings.
  - **Rationale:** As recipe collections grow, discoverability becomes crucial for user engagement. The intelligent filtering system now considers user preferences to surface recipes that truly match their cooking style, time constraints, and dietary needs. This dramatically improves recipe relevance and encourages both exploration and regular use of saved recipes.

- **User Profile & Navigation: Modal-Based Settings**
  - **Description:** Renamed "Settings" tab to "Profile" reflecting the achievement-focused content. Settings moved to a clean Sheet modal accessible via gear icon, eliminating the need to scroll through long profile content to access configuration options.
  - **Rationale:** Clear separation between motivational profile content (achievements, progress, stats) and functional settings (account, API keys, profile reset). Modal-based settings provide immediate access without disrupting the profile viewing experience, following modern mobile UX patterns.

- **Enhanced Modal & Sheet Experience**
  - **Description:** Comprehensive modal height optimization: (1) Settings, Edit Preferences, and Grocery List modals now use full-height snap points (90%-95%) with proper expansion, (2) Fixed modal index to ensure immediate full expansion, (3) Eliminated mid-screen modal positioning issues that cut off content, (4) Consistent bottom sheet behavior across all modal interactions.
  - **Rationale:** Professional modal experience prevents user frustration from inaccessible content. Full-height modals maximize content visibility and eliminate scrolling issues. Consistent behavior across all modals creates predictable user interactions and improves overall app polish.

  - **Rationale:** Modern slider interface feels more intuitive and responsive than button arrays. Color progression provides immediate visual feedback for difficulty selection. Reduced visual clutter improves screen space utilization. Progressive colors help users understand difficulty spectrum at a glance.

- **Optimized Cooking Coach Experience**
  - **Description:** Streamlined cooking guidance interface: (1) Fixed progression bar calculation to properly show step completion (0% at start, 100% at final step), (2) Removed timer functionality to focus on step-by-step guidance, (3) Eliminated UI clutter while maintaining core coaching features, (4) Improved visual progress feedback during cooking sessions.
  - **Rationale:** Timer functionality added complexity without significant user value. Focus on core step-by-step guidance improves user experience during cooking. Accurate progression bar provides better feedback on cooking session progress. Streamlined interface reduces cognitive load during cooking.

- **Intuitive Meal Planning Workflow**
  - **Description:** Context-aware recipe addition system: (1) "Add Recipe" button automatically adds recipe to originally selected meal slot (breakfast, lunch, dinner), (2) Enhanced success messaging showing recipe name and target meal slot, (3) Fixed navigation flow to return to meal planner after recipe addition, (4) Pull-to-refresh functionality for viewing newly added recipes, (5) Intelligent meal plan refresh preventing infinite loading loops.
  - **Rationale:** Direct meal slot assignment matches user mental model and eliminates confusion about where recipes are added. Clear feedback confirms successful recipe addition. Proper navigation flow maintains user context. Pull-to-refresh provides manual control over data synchronization while preventing automatic refresh loops that degrade performance.

- **Core UX Problem-Solving:**
  - **Problem:** The initial implementation of the grocery list feature used a native `<Modal>`, which created a new rendering window on iOS. This prevented our toast notifications from appearing on top of the modal content.
  - **Solution 1 (Toast):** Replaced a custom toast implementation with the `react-native-toast-message` library. **Rationale:** The library correctly handles native rendering contexts and edge cases, ensuring notifications always appear on top of all other UI elements.
  - **Solution 2 (Modal):** Replaced the native `<Modal>` with a custom `Sheet.tsx` component built with `react-native-reanimated`. **Rationale:** This ensures our "modal" is just a standard view within the app's main rendering window, guaranteeing that other overlay components (like toasts) will work as expected. This also gives us a reusable, theme-able sheet component for future features.

- **Implementation:**
  ```typescript
  const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are Sage, an expert, encouraging, and patient AI cooking coach. Your primary goal is to make cooking accessible and enjoyable for beginners. You must ALWAYS prioritize user safety, especially regarding allergies and dietary restrictions. All your responses must be in JSON format as specified in the user's prompt.`;
  
  this.model = this.genAI.getGenerativeModel({
    model: "gemini-1.5-flash",
    generationConfig: { responseMimeType: "application/json" },
    systemInstruction: SYSTEM_PROMPT,
  });
  ```
- **Impact:** Consistent AI persona, reduced token usage, cleaner individual prompts

**5.2 Few-Shot Prompting for JSON Consistency**
- **Problem:** AI occasionally deviates from requested JSON structure
- **Solution:** Implement few-shot prompting with high-quality examples
- **Implementation:**
  - Add EXAMPLE section to `generateRecipe` prompt:
    ```
    Here is an example of a perfect response:
    EXAMPLE INPUT: "A quick, healthy lunch with chicken"
    EXAMPLE OUTPUT: {
      "recipeName": "15-Minute Lemon Herb Chicken and Asparagus",
      "difficulty": 2,
      // ... complete example with all required fields
    }
    ```
- **Impact:** Dramatically improved structural consistency, reduced parsing errors

### **Priority 6: Database Optimization & Schema Improvements**

**Objective:** Implement production-grade database optimizations with automated data integrity and performance enhancements.

**6.1 Meal Plan Uniqueness Enforcement**

- **Solution:** Add unique constraint preventing future duplicates
- **Implementation:**
  ```sql
  -- Create migration 11_unique_meal_plan.sql
  ALTER TABLE public.meal_plans
  ADD CONSTRAINT user_week_unique UNIQUE (user_id, week_start_date);
  ```
- **Impact:** Data integrity, prevented duplicate creation, cleaner meal plan queries

**6.2 Automated Recipe Macro Population**
- **Problem:** Top-level nutrition columns in `user_recipes` inconsistently populated from JSONB data
- **Solution:** Create database trigger for automatic field population
- **Implementation:**
  ```sql
  -- Create migration 12_populate_recipe_macros.sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION populate_recipe_details_from_json()
  RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
  BEGIN
    NEW.calories_per_serving := COALESCE((NEW.recipe_data->>'caloriesPerServing')::integer, NEW.calories_per_serving);
    NEW.protein_per_serving := COALESCE((NEW.recipe_data->>'proteinPerServing')::numeric, NEW.protein_per_serving);
    NEW.carbs_per_serving := COALESCE((NEW.recipe_data->>'carbsPerServing')::numeric, NEW.carbs_per_serving);
    NEW.fat_per_serving := COALESCE((NEW.recipe_data->>'fatPerServing')::numeric, NEW.fat_per_serving);
    -- ... other fields
    RETURN NEW;
  END;
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
  
  CREATE TRIGGER trigger_populate_recipe_details
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON public.user_recipes
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION populate_recipe_details_from_json();
