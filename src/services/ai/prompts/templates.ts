// Enhanced instruction guidelines for recipe generation
export const INSTRUCTION_GUIDELINES = `
ENHANCED COOKING INSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Write instructions with rich sensory descriptions to guide beginners
- Include visual cues: "until golden brown and crispy", "when the edges start to curl", "until bubbling vigorously"
- Add auditory cues: "you'll hear gentle sizzling", "when the bubbling subsides", "listen for the popping sound"
- Include textural guidance: "until fork-tender", "when it feels firm to the touch", "until it coats the back of a spoon"
- Describe aromatic indicators: "when fragrant", "until you smell the garlic blooming", "when the spices become aromatic"
- Mention timing alongside sensory cues: "Saut√© for 3-4 minutes until the onions become translucent and smell sweet"
- Help beginners know what "done" looks like: "The sauce should be thick enough to coat pasta without pooling"
- Include confidence-building phrases: "Don't worry if it takes a bit longer", "This is normal", "You're doing great"
- Provide alternatives for common issues: "If it's browning too fast, lower the heat", "If too thick, add a splash of water"

export const COST_ESTIMATION_GUIDELINES = `
COST ESTIMATION GUIDELINES:
- Use average US grocery store prices for ingredients
- Consider typical package sizes (e.g., if recipe needs 1 onion, estimate cost of 1 onion from a 3lb bag)
- Account for pantry staples at reduced cost (spices, oil, etc.)
- Be realistic and helpful with cost estimates
- Round costs to nearest $0.05 for readability
`;

export const NUTRITIONAL_GUIDELINES = `
NUTRITIONAL CALCULATION GUIDELINES:
- Calculate macros based on ingredient quantities and standard nutritional data
- Account for cooking methods (oils, cooking losses, etc.)
- Provide realistic estimates based on typical ingredient compositions
- Round calories to nearest 5, macros to 1 decimal place
- Consider the user's macro goals when possible
- Include approximate sodium content for health awareness
- Fiber content helps with satiety and health goals
