## üõ† IMMEDIATE DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS

```bash
cd /d/repos/Sage

# CURRENT STATUS: UI Prototype with AI integration
# CRITICAL: Remove API keys from app.json before any commits
# NEXT: Implement database schema and security fixes

npx expo start
# Current app: Sophisticated UI prototype, no backend
```

## ‚ùì QUESTIONS FOR NEXT DEVELOPMENT SESSION

### Technical Architecture

1. **Database Design:** Review and approve Supabase schema before implementation?
2. **Environment Strategy:** Use Expo SecureStore vs environment variables for API keys?
3. **Subscription Model:** RevenueCat vs direct Stripe integration for payments?
4. **Analytics Platform:** Mixpanel vs Amplitude for user behavior tracking?

### Business Priorities

1. **Feature Prioritization:** Grocery lists vs progress tracking first?
2. **Launch Timeline:** Prefer 12-week aggressive timeline vs 16-week realistic?
3. **Partnership Strategy:** When to involve Pranay as business co-founder?
4. **Beta Testing:** Target demographic for initial 50-100 beta testers?

### Development Approach

1. **Security First:** Start with environment/security fixes before features?
2. **Database First:** Complete schema design before UI integration?
3. **Authentication First:** Full auth flow before business features?
4. **MVP Scope:** Include grocery lists in MVP or post-launch feature?
