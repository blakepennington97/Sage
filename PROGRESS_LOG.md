## ðŸš§ CURRENT STATUS: Basic Prototype Complete

### What We Have
- Interactive onboarding (skills + kitchen assessment)
- Personalized AI recipe generation
- Step-by-step cooking guidance with timers
- Local recipe storage and favorites
- Basic navigation and loading states

### What's Missing for True MVP

#### Core MVP Features (From Business Plan)
- [ ] **Grocery List Optimization** - Organized by store sections, substitutions
- [ ] **Progress Tracking** - Skill development over time, cooking analytics
- [ ] **Ingredient Substitution Engine** - Real-time swaps based on availability
- [ ] **Recipe Success Feedback** - Rating system, improvement loops
- [ ] **Technique Explanations** - Video/text library for cooking basics
- [ ] **Advanced Recipe Formatting** - Better parsing, step clarity

#### Scalability & System Design Issues
- [ ] **User Authentication** - Currently local-only, no accounts
- [ ] **Cloud Sync** - Profile/recipe data tied to device
- [ ] **Backend Infrastructure** - No server, database, or APIs
- [ ] **Analytics System** - No business metrics or user insights
- [ ] **Customer Support** - No help system or user management
- [ ] **Subscription System** - No payment processing or premium features

#### Technical Debt
- [ ] **Navigation Types** - Proper TypeScript navigation
- [ ] **Error Boundaries** - App-wide error handling
- [ ] **Performance** - Image optimization, bundle size
- [ ] **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests
- [ ] **CI/CD** - Automated build/deploy pipeline

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT PHASE: MVP Foundation Development

- Organized by store sections
- Substitution suggestions
- Shopping list optimization

**Priority 2: Substitution Engine**
- Ingredient database
- Allergy/preference handling
- Real-time recipe modifications

**Priority 3: Progress Tracking**
- Skill level advancement
- Cooking confidence metrics
- Achievement system

### Phase 3: Polish & Intelligence (3-4 weeks)
**Priority 1: Technique System**
- Video explanations
- Interactive cooking guides
- Skill-building progression

**Priority 2: Business Analytics**
- User engagement tracking
- Recipe success rates
- Premium conversion metrics

**Priority 3: Advanced Personalization**

## ðŸš¨ Critical Gaps for Launch

### Business Model Requirements
- No subscription system (core revenue model)
- No user accounts (can't track customer lifecycle)
- No analytics (can't optimize for retention/conversion)
- No customer support infrastructure

### Competitive Differentiation
- Missing grocery list optimization (key differentiator)
- No progress tracking (confidence building USP)
- Limited technique explanations (beginner focus)
- Basic substitution handling

### Scalability Blockers
- Local-only storage (won't scale to multiple devices)
- No backend (can't update/improve remotely)
- No A/B testing capability
- Manual recipe curation only

## ðŸ“Š Realistic Timeline to Launch

**Minimum 12-16 weeks additional development:**
- Phase 1 (Foundation): 4-6 weeks
- Phase 2 (Core Features): 3-4 weeks  
- Phase 3 (Polish): 3-4 weeks
- UI/UX Redesign: 2-3 weeks
- Testing & Launch Prep: 1-2 weeks

## ðŸ”§ Technology Decisions Needed

### Backend Architecture
- Firebase vs Supabase vs custom Node.js
- User authentication provider
- Recipe database structure
- Analytics platform (Mixpanel, Amplitude)

### Payment Processing
- Stripe vs RevenueCat for subscriptions
- Premium feature gating strategy
- Free tier limitations

### Content Management
- Recipe creation/editing system
- Technique video hosting
- Ingredient database source

## Commands for New Development Session

```bash
cd /d/repos/Sage
npx expo start
# Current app: Local prototype with basic functionality
```

## Test Flow (Current Capabilities)
1. **First Launch:** Complete Skills â†’ Kitchen onboarding
2. **Recipe Generation:** Generate personalized recipe
3. **Cooking Coach:** Step-by-step guidance with timers
4. **Limitations:** All local storage, no user accounts, basic features only

## Questions for Next Session
1. Backend choice: Firebase vs Supabase vs custom?
2. Start with user auth or grocery list feature?
3. Focus on one vertical (grocery lists) or foundation-first?
4. Timeline preference: MVP in 3 months or polished app in 6 months?
