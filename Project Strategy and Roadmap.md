## üìù Instructions for Future Updates

_This section is a meta-guide on how to maintain this document._

**When to Update:** This document should be updated after any significant architectural change, phase completion, or strategic pivot.

**How to Update:**

1.  **Move Completed Items:** When a "Next Step" or "Priority" item is finished, move it from the "Roadmap" section to the "Current State & Architecture" section.
2.  **Update the Status:** Modify the "Project Status" section to reflect the new reality of the project (e.g., from "Architectural Refactor" to "Core Feature Development").
3.  **Refine the Roadmap:** Based on the work just completed, review and refine the next steps in the "Strategic Roadmap" section. Add, remove, or re-prioritize items as needed.
4.  **Update the Timestamp:** Always change the "Last Updated" date at the top of the file.

## üöÄ Project Status & Vision

**Vision:** To transform "kitchen anxious" beginners into confident home cooks through a delightful, AI-powered companion that adapts to their skill level, available tools, and preferences.

**Current Status (as of June 14, 2025): Phase 2 Complete - Core Value Proposition Built**

The project has successfully built and polished its core user experience. The application now functions as a personalized digital cookbook with a "sticky" and magical core loop. The foundation is robust, and the app is ready for features that will drive long-term retention and engagement.

## üèõÔ∏è Current State & Architecture (The "As-Is")

_This section details what has been built and the technical decisions made. It is a log of our completed progress._

### **Core App Structure (Completed)**

- **Navigation:** A scalable Stack -> Tab navigation structure is in place using React Navigation.
- **Home Screen:** The `RecipeBookScreen` serves as the app's home base, displaying a user's saved recipes in a visual grid.
- **Recipe Management:** Users can view recipe details, start a cooking session, and generate grocery lists.
- **Recipe Generation:** The `RecipeGenerationScreen` functions as a modal, feeding new recipes into the user's cookbook.

### **Key Features (Completed)**

- **The "My Recipes" Hub:** The `RecipeBookScreen`, `RecipeDetailScreen`, and `RecipeCard` components create a persistent, personalized cookbook experience.
- **AI-Powered Grocery Lists:** `GeminiService` can generate a markdown-formatted grocery list from any recipe, which can be copied to the clipboard. This is the app's first "magic" feature.
- **Polished Core Loop:**
  - **Toggle Favorites:** Users can favorite/unfavorite recipes with instant UI feedback and a backend save.
  - **Auto-Refreshing Data:** The `RecipeBookScreen` uses a focus listener to automatically fetch the latest data, ensuring `cook_count` and `is_favorite` status are always current.
  - **Intelligent AI Parsing:** The app now parses AI-generated recipes to extract and store structured data like `difficulty_level` and `estimated_time`, which are displayed in the UI.

### **Backend & Data Layer (Completed)**

- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL is the primary database.
- **Schema:** Tables for `user_profiles`, `user_recipes`, and `cooking_sessions` are implemented. The `user_recipes` table now includes `difficulty_level` and `estimated_time`.
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth is fully integrated.

### **Frontend Architecture & Logic (Completed)**

- **State Management:** `zustand` (`authStore.ts`) manages global user state.
- **Data Fetching:** Custom hooks (`useUserProfile.ts`, `useRecipes.ts`) handle all data interactions and include optimistic updates and refetching logic.

## üó∫Ô∏è Strategic Roadmap (The "To-Be")

_This section outlines the planned next phases of development, prioritized by value delivery._

### **PHASE 3: Drive Retention & Deeper Engagement**

**Goal:** Give users reasons to come back every day and feel a sense of progress.

- üéØ **Priority 1: Search & Filtering**

  - **Action:** Add a search bar to the `RecipeBookScreen`.
  - **Action:** Enhance the `useRecipes` hook and `RecipeService` to support full-text search on `recipe_name` and `recipe_content` in Supabase.
  - **Action:** Add UI for filtering recipes by `difficulty_level` and `is_favorite`.
  - **Why:** As the user's recipe book grows, discoverability becomes critical for the app to remain useful.

- üéØ **Priority 2: User Profile & Progress Tracking**

  - **Action:** Create a `ProfileScreen.tsx` accessible from the tab bar (replacing the current `SettingsScreen` tab, which can be moved into the profile screen).
  - **Action:** Display user stats from their profile (skill level, etc.) and aggregated data (recipes cooked, sessions completed).
  - **Action:** Introduce simple badges or achievements based on their activity (e.g., "First Recipe Cooked," "Weekend Chef," "5 Meals Logged").
  - **Why:** Creates a sense of accomplishment and a feedback loop that encourages continued use.

- üéØ **Priority 3: Recipe Ratings & Feedback**
  - **Action:** After a `CookingCoachScreen` session, present a simple modal asking the user to rate the recipe (1-5 stars).
  - **Action:** Store this `user_rating` in the `user_recipes` table.
  - **Action:** Display the user's own rating on the `RecipeDetailScreen`.
  - **Why:** This closes the feedback loop on a recipe and provides valuable data for future features (e.g., "Your Highest Rated Recipes").

### **PHASE 4: Monetize & Scale**

**Goal:** With a valuable and engaging product, introduce a business model.

- üéØ **Action: Implement Meal Planning (The First Premium Feature)**
- üéØ **Action: Integrate Production Services (RevenueCat, Sentry, Mixpanel)**
- üéØ **Action: Launch & Learn**

## ‚ùì Open Questions for Next Session

1.  **Search Implementation:** For the search feature, should we start with a simple client-side filter on the already-fetched recipes, or build the more robust server-side full-text search in Supabase from the start? (Recommendation: Build the server-side search. It's more scalable and a good opportunity to learn Supabase's capabilities).
2.  **Profile vs. Settings:** Does merging "Settings" into a new, more comprehensive "Profile" tab make sense? (Recommendation: Yes, it cleans up the tab bar and centralizes all user-centric actions).
3.  **Next Step:** Are we ready to begin building the search bar UI on `RecipeBookScreen` and the corresponding backend logic in `useRecipes`?
